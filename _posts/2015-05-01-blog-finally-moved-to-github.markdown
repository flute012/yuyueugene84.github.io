##**Bloging**
Ever since I started spending a lot of time with Ruby on Rails, people always tell me that I must create and record the learning experience in my own blog. This post is about a few blogging service and solution I used or tried to use, and my thoughts on them.

**tumblr**

I first registered for tumblr back in my grad school days, I put the project but it turns out that it is very difficult to post code snippets on tumblr, plus tumblr is not a platform that is intended for engineers and programmers. 

**Logdown**

I did some research and came across logdown, which is a nice blogging service built specifically for programmers, and its backend markdown editor makes blogging with code snippets a snap. I recorded most of my Tealeaf learning experience in Logdown, but the more blog I wrote the more I realized that Logdown has a lot of shortcomings, such as there is no way to include images and graphs in a blog post, because it is reserved as a premium feature in Logdown. So I that is when I decided to seek other blogging platform to replace Logdown.

**Github Pages**

Then by some luck I found Github page, which is a way for github users to build blogs and official web pages of Github projects with Jekyll, then simply host them on Github! Although I know nothing about Jekyll, but like Kennedy said: "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because it was easy, but because it was hard!". As an engineer, I should seek and embrace the unknown and push myself to grow. So I followed the official guide on github:

<a href="https://pages.github.com/ ">Github Pages</a>

And it took me around half an hour to build and host my blog on github, easy as pie!
